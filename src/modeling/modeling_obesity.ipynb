    "We wanted to find the counties within the contingous US that could be described as food desserts. One definition of  'food dessert', provided by the Annie E Casie foundation can be found [here](https://www.aecf.org/blog/exploring-americas-food-deserts),and other sources present a similar idea. The food insecurity variable in our data, obtained from Feeding America and coded as the fi_rate column, was calculated using many of the factors already described in the food insecurity definition found above; the calculation can be found [here](https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/research/map-the-meal-gap/2016/2016-map-the-meal-gap-technical-brief.pdf). What was missing was a variable for access to food. Considering we had already created a proxy for access to food (healthy_access_category which encompasses grocery stores, supercenters, restaurants, and farmers markets), we decided to use both fi_rate and healthy_access_category to determine whether or not a county was labelled as being a food dessert.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third quartile for food insecurity is at about 15.200000 meaning 75 percent is at or below that value. We decided that any county in the highest 25% would be considered the 'highest tier' of food insecurity. We chose to take the top 25% because it is marginally conservative. We then decided too be food insecure, the county not only had to be within the top 25% of insecure counties in the United states but also have either low or medium access to healthy foods."
